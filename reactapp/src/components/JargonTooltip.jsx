  },
  'Return Potential': {
    short: 'Projected yearly earnings',
    plain: 'The range of growth you can expect per year. The actual return depends on market conditions, but this range is based on historical performance.',
  },
  'Alpha': {
    short: 'Extra return above the benchmark',
    plain: 'The extra return a fund earns compared to its benchmark index. If Nifty 50 grew 12% and your fund grew 15%, the alpha is 3%.',
  },
  'NAV': {
    short: 'Net Asset Value — price per unit',

  },
  'Volatility': {
    short: 'Price ups and downs',
    plain: 'How much the investment\'s value jumps around. High volatility means it can drop 20% one month and rise 25% the next. Over 7+ years, the ups usually outweigh the downs.',
  },
  'Drawdown': {
    short: 'Temporary drop from the peak',
    plain: 'The biggest temporary fall in value from its highest point. A 30% drawdown means your ₹10,000 temporarily became ₹7,000 before recovering.',
