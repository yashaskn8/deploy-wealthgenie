/**
 * WealthGenie Risk Profiler
 * Categorizes users into risk buckets based on age + annual income + investment horizon + financial ratios.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 * 📘 BEGINNER NOTE: WHAT IS COMPOSITE RISK SCORING?
 * =========================================================================
 * Risk capacity is not just about how you "feel" about the stock market. It is
 * a mathematical combination of your ability to take risk (financial strength)
 * and your timeline (investment horizon).
 * 
 * WealthGenie uses a 3-Factor Composite Scoring Model (ranging from 0 to 100 points):
 * 
 * 1. Age (0–40 points): Younger investors have more decades ahead of them. If the 
 *    market crashes tomorrow, they have time to wait for a recovery before needing
 *    the money. Thus: Younger = Higher Risk Score.
 * 
 * 2. Annual Income (0–40 points): Higher earners have a larger financial cushion.
 *    If an emergency occurs, they can cover it from their current cash flow rather than
 *    being forced to sell investments at a loss. Thus: Higher Income = Higher Risk Score.
 * 
 * 3. Investment Horizon (0–20 points): How long will the money stay invested? 
 *    If you need the money in 2 years, you cannot afford a market crash (low risk). 
 *    If you need it in 20 years, short-term crashes don't matter because the market
 *    historically trends upwards over long periods. Thus: Longer Horizon = Higher Risk Score.
 * 
 * We also subtract penalties for high debt levels or dependents, giving us a highly
 * personalized, mathematically balanced risk score. This avoids the "cliff-edge"
 * problem where a ₹1 income difference shifts you from Moderate to Conservative.
